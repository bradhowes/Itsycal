# Changes

* I added two additional icon formats for the menu bar. I like a bit of color to aim for instead of a sea of greys, so the new formats have a red border at the top to help the icon stand out.
* I updated the preference window to allow the new icon variants.
* I applied [pull request #90](https://github.com/sfsam/Itsycal/pull/90) that allows for hiding of the month outline.

# Original README.txt

I've learned a lot by looking at other people's code so
maybe someone can learn something from looking at mine.

Itsycal is a tiny calendar for your Mac's menu bar.

If you want, it will display your calendar events as a
companion to the Mac Calendar app. You can also create
and delete (but not edit) events.
